# MICROMOUSE
This is all about making a robot which is autonomous and able to crack a maze
i.e: It should solve an obstacle maze(In a shortest time/distance) .
We are going to make a controll system suitable for requirement
We use various types of sensors
And also we work with Algorithms (search algorithms)
