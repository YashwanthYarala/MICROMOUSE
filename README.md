# MICROMOUSE
This is all about making a robot which is autonomous and able to crack a maze
i.e: It should solve an obstacle maze(In a shortest time/distance) .
We are going to make a controll system suitable for requirement
We use various types of sensors
And also we work with Algorithms (search algorithms)

As per initial start 
We are gonna use Arduino Mega as our micro-controller
